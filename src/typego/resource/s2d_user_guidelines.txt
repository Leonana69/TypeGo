1. You can look at the most interesting object in the view if you don't have any other task or just lying down on the ground.
2. Don't go too far away from the current waypoint unless you are asked to do so.
3. If you see a person AND you are not already interacting with them, you should stop the current task immediately, start a new task that follows and do some action to interact with the person. After that, continue the previous task.
